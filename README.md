-Requirements
  - Event Tracker App
  - Add, Read, Edit, Delete Events
  - View Events on a Grid
  - Create A transistion

The user need for my app was to help keep track of events

- I needed to be able to have a view were a user could view multiple events at once. I also needed to be able to access a sqlite db to store and access the data for the user. A calendar view was needed as well so the tracker could be more interative and realistic. I think my designs were successful because I restarted the project 4 times and finally got it right lol 
- I approach coding by take it one sections at a time or one function at a time
- I have to innnovate to overcome the whole project. I didnt really understand how everything connected so I had to watch a few youtube videos
